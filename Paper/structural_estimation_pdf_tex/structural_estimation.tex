\begin{abstract}
Heterogeneous Agent Models (HAM) are a powerful tool for understanding the effects of monetary and fiscal policy on the economy. However, current state-of-the-art frameworks such as Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models have limitations that hinder their ability to accurately replicate real-world economic phenomena. Specifically, HANK models struggle to account for the observed hoarding of wealth at the very top of the distribution and lack important life cycle properties such as time-varying preferences, mortality, and income risk. On the one hand, the inability to pin down wealth at the tail of the distribution has been a problem for HANK models precisely because it has implications for the transmission of monetary and fiscal policy. On the other hand, agents in HANK are generally conceived as perpetual youth with infinite horizons and without age-specific profiles of mortality and income risk. This is problematic as it ignores the effects of these policies on potentially more affected communities, such as young families with children or the low-wealth elderly. In this paper, I investigate the effects of both life cycle considerations as well as wealth in the utility on the structural estimation of HAMs. Structural estimation is the first step in evaluating the effect of monetary and fiscal policies in a HANK framework, and my hope is that this paper will lead to better models of the economy that can be used to inform policy.

\keywords{structural estimation, life cycle, wealth in the utility}

%  Heterogeneous Agent Models (HAM) have become a popular tool for understanding the effects of monetary and fiscal policy on the economy. However, current state-of-the-art frameworks such as Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models have limitations that hinder their ability to accurately replicate real-world economic phenomena. Specifically, HANK models struggle to account for the observed hoarding of wealth at the very top of the distribution and lack important life cycle properties such as time-varying mortality and income risk. These limitations are problematic because they affect the transmission of monetary and fiscal policy and ignore the effects of these policies on potentially more affected communities, such as young families with children or the low-wealth elderly.
% 
% To address these limitations, this paper investigates the effects of both life cycle considerations and wealth in the utility on the structural estimation of HAMs. By incorporating these factors into the model, we aim to provide a more accurate representation of the economy and its response to monetary and fiscal policy. Our research methodology involves using a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical data to estimate the parameters of the model.
% 
% Our findings suggest that incorporating life cycle considerations and wealth in the utility can significantly improve the accuracy of HAMs. This has important implications for policymakers who rely on these models to inform their decisions. By providing a more accurate representation of the economy, our research can help policymakers make better-informed decisions that benefit all members of society. Overall, we hope that our research will contribute to the development of better models of the economy that can be used to inform policy.

\section{Life Cycle Incomplete Markets Models}\label{Life Cycle Incomplete Markets Models}

An important extension to the Standard Incomplete Markets (SIM) model is the Life Cycle Incomplete Markets (LCIM) model as in \cite{Cagetti_2003}, \cite{Gourinchas_2002}, and \cite{Palumbo_1999}, among others. The LCIM model is a natural extension to the SIM model that allows for age-specific profiles of preferences, mortality, and income risk.

\subsection{The Baseline Model}\label{The Baseline Model}

The agent's objective is to maximize present discounted utility from consumption over the life cycle with a terminal period of $T$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lifecyclemax}
\vFunc_{t}(\pLvl_{t},\mLvl_{t})  =    \max_{\{\cFunc\}_{t}^{T}} ~ \uFunc(\cLvl_{t})+\Ex_{t}\left[\sum_{n=1}^{T-t} {\beth}^{n} \Alive_{t}^{t+n}\hat{\DiscFac}_{t}^{t+n} \uFunc(\cLvl_{t+n}) \right]
\end{equation}

where $\pLvl_{t}$ is the permanent income level, $\mLvl_{t}$ is total market resources, $\cLvl_{t}$ is consumption, and

\begin{equation}
\begin{align}
    \beth & :  \text{time-invariant `pure' discount factor}
    \\ \Alive _{t}^{t+n} & :  \text{probability to }\Alive\text{ive until age $t+n$ given alive at age $t$}
    \\ \hat{\DiscFac}_{t}^{t+n} & :  \text{age-varying discount factor between ages $t$ and $t+n$.}
\end{align}
\end{equation}

It will be convenient to work with the problem in permanent-income-normalized form as in \cite{Carroll_2004}, which allows us to reduce a 2 dimensional problem of permanent income and wealth into a 1 dimensional problem of wealth normalized by permanent income. The recursive Bellman equation can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{align}
    {\vFunc}_{t}({m}_{t}) & = \max_{\cNrm_{t}} ~ \uFunc(\cNrm_{t})+\beth\Alive_{t+1}\hat{\DiscFac}_{t+1}
    \Ex_{t}[(\PermShk_{t+1}\PermGroFac_{t+1})^{1-\CRRA}{\vFunc}_{t+1}({m}_{t+1})]
    \\ & \text{s.t.} & 
    \\ \aNrm_{t} & = {m}_{t}-\cNrm_{t} 
    \\ {m}_{t+1} & = \aNrm_{t}\underbrace{\left(\frac{\Rfree}{\PermShk_{t+1}\PermGroFac_{t+1}}\right)}_{\equiv \RNrm_{t+1}}
    + ~\TranShkEmp_{t+1}
\end{align}
\end{equation}

where $\cNrm$, $\aNrm$, and $\mNrm$ are consumption, assets, and market resources normalized by permanent income, respectively, $\vFunc$ and $\uFunc$ are now the normalized value and utility functions,  and

\begin{equation}
\begin{align}
  \PermShk_{t+1} & :  \text{mean-one shock to permanent income}
    \\ \PermGroFac_{t+1} & :  \text{permanent income growth factor}
    \\ \TranShkEmp_{t+1} & :  \text{transitory shock to permanent income}
    \\ \RNrm_{t+1} & :  \text{permanent income growth normalized return factor}
\end{align}
\end{equation}

with all other variables are defined as above. The transitory and permanent shocks to income are defined as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{align}
\TranShkEmp_{s}  = &
    \begin{cases}
        0\phantom{/\pZero} & \text{with probability $\pZero>0$}
        \\ \xi_{s}/\pZero & \text{with probability $(1-\pZero)$, where
            $\log \xi_{s}\thicksim \mathcal{N}(-\sigma_{[\xi, t]}^{2}/2,\sigma_{[\xi, t]}^{2})$}
    \end{cases}
    \\ \phantom{/\pZero} \\ & \text{and }  \log \PermShk_{s}   \thicksim \mathcal{N}(-\sigma_{[\PermShk, t]}^{2}/2,\sigma_{[\PermShk, t]}^{2}).
  \end{align}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Wealth in the Utility Function}\label{Wealth in the Utility Function}

A simple extension to the Life Cycle Incomplete Markets (LCIM) model is to include wealth in the utility function. \cite{Carroll_1998} argues that models in which the only driver of wealth accumulation is consumption smoothing are not consistent with the saving behavior of the wealthiest households. Instead, they propose a model in which households derive utility from their level of wealth itself or they derive a flow of services from political power and social status, calling it the `Capitalist Spirit' model. In turn, we can add this feature to the LCIM model by adding a utility function with consumption and wealth. We call this the Wealth in the Utility Function Incomplete Markets (WUFIM) model.

\begin{equation}
\begin{align}
    {\vFunc}_{t}({m}_{t}) & = \max_{\cNrm_{t}} ~ \uFunc(\cNrm_{t}, \aNrm_{t})+\beth\Alive_{t+1}\hat{\DiscFac}_{t+1}
    \Ex_{t}[(\PermShk_{t+1}\PermGroFac_{t+1})^{1-\CRRA}{\vFunc}_{t+1}({m}_{t+1})]
    \\ & \text{s.t.} & 
    \\ \aNrm_{t} & = {m}_{t}-\cNrm_{t} 
    \\ {m}_{t+1} & = \aNrm_{t}\RNrm_{t+1}+ ~\TranShkEmp_{t+1}
\end{align}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Separable Utility} \cite{Carroll_1998} presents extensive empirical and informal evidence for a LCIM model with wealth in the utility function. Specifically, the paper uses a utility that is separable in consumption and wealth:

\begin{equation}
\uFunc(\cNrm_{t}, \aNrm_{t}) = \frac{\cNrm_{t}^{1-\CRRA}}{1-\CRRA}
    + \kapShare_{t} \frac{(\aFunc_{t} - \underline\aNrm)^{1-\wealthShare}}{1-\wealthShare}
\end{equation}

where $\kapShare$ is the relative weight of the utility of wealth and $\wealthShare$ is the relative risk aversion of wealth.

\textbf{Non-separable Utility} A different model that we will explore is one in which the utility function is non-separable in consumption and wealth; i.e. consumption and wealth are complimentary goods. In the case of the LCIM model, this dynamic complementarity drives the accumulation of wealth not only for the sake of wealth itself, but also because it increases the marginal utility of consumption.

\begin{equation}
\uFunc(\cNrm_{t}, \aNrm_{t}) = \frac{(\cNrm_{t}^{1-\wealthShare} (\aNrm_{t} - \underline\aNrm)^\wealthShare)^{1-\CRRA}}{(1-\CRRA)}
\end{equation}

\section{Solution Methods}\label{Solution Methods}

For a brief departure, let's consider how we solve these problems generally. Define the post-decision value function as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{align}
    \DiscFac_{t+1} \wFunc_{t}(\aNrm_{t}) & = \beth\Alive_{t+1}\hat{\DiscFac}_{t+1}
    \Ex_{t}[(\PermShk_{t+1}\PermGroFac_{t+1})^{1-\CRRA}{\vFunc}_{t+1}({m}_{t+1})]
    \\ & \text{s.t.}
    \\ {m}_{t+1} & = \aNrm_{t}\RNrm_{t+1}+ ~\TranShkEmp_{t+1}
\end{align}
\end{equation}

For our purposes, it will be useful to simplify the notation a bit by dropping time subscripts. The recursive problem can then be written as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{align}
    \vFunc(\mRat) & = \max_{\cNrm} ~ \uFunc(\cNrm, \aNrm) + \DiscFac \wFunc(\aRat)
    \\ & \text{s.t.}
    \\ \aNrm & = \mRat-\cNrm
\end{align}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Endogenous Grid Method, Abridged}\label{Endogenous Grid Method, Abridged}

In the standard incomplete markets (SIM) model, the utility function is simply $\uFunc(\cNrm)$ and the Euler equation is $\uFunc'(\cNrm) = \DiscFac \wFunc'(\aNrm)$, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for an internal solution of the optimal choice of consumption. If $\uFunc(\cNrm)$ is differentiable and its marginal utility is invertible, then the Euler equation can be inverted to obtain the optimal consumption function as $\cNrm(\aNrm) = \uFunc'^{ -1}(\DiscFac \wFunc'(\aNrm))$. Using an \textit{exogenous} grid of post-decision savings $\aMat$, we can obtain an \textit{endogenous} grid of market resources $\mMat$ by using the budget constraint $\mNrm(\aMat) = \aMat + \cNrm(\aMat)$ such that this collection of grids satisfy the Euler equation. This is the endogenous grid method (EGM) of \cite{Carroll_2006}.

In the presence of wealth in the utility function, the Euler equation is more complicated and may not be invertible in terms of optimal consumption. Consider the first order condition for an optimal combination of consumption and savings, denoted by $^*$:

\begin{equation}
\uFunc_{c}'(\cNrm^*, \aNrm^*) - \uFunc_{a}'(\cNrm^*, \aNrm^*) = \DiscFac \wFunc'(\aNrm^*)
\end{equation}

If the utility of consumption and wealth is additively separable, then the Euler equation can be written as $\uFunc_{c}'(\cNrm) = \uFunc_{a}'(\aNrm) + \DiscFac \wFunc'(\aNrm)$. This makes sense, as the agent will equalize the marginal utility of consumption with the marginal utility of wealth today plus the discounted marginal value of wealth tomorrow. In this case, the EGM is simple: we can invert the Euler equation to obtain the optimal consumption policy as $\cNrm(\aNrm) = \uFunc_{c}'^{ -1}\big(\uFunc_{a}'(\aNrm) + \DiscFac \wFunc'(\aNrm)\big)$. We can proceed with EGM as usual, using the budget constraint to obtain the endogenous grid of market resources $\mNrm(\aMat) = \aMat + \cNrm(\aMat)$.

\subsection{Root Finding}\label{Root Finding}

When the utility of consumption and wealth is not additively separable, the Euler equation is not analytically invertible for the optimal consumption policy. The usual recourse is to use a root-finding algorithm to obtain the optimal consumption policy for each point on the grid of market resources, which turns out to be more efficient than grid search maximization.

Holding $\mNrm$ constant, we can define a function $f_{m}$ as the difference between the marginal utility of consumption and the marginal utility of wealth:

\begin{equation}
f_{m}(\cNrm) = \uFunc_{c}'(\cNrm, \mNrm - \cNrm) - \uFunc_{a}'(\cNrm, \mNrm - \cNrm) - \DiscFac \wFunc'(\mNrm - \cNrm)
\end{equation}

The optimal consumption policy is the value of $\cNrm$ that satisfies $f_{m}(\cNrm) = 0$. We can use a root-finding algorithm to obtain the optimal consumption policy for each point on the grid of market resources. Although this is more efficient than grid search maximization, it is still computationally expensive. Unlike the single-step EGM, root finding requires a number of iterations to find the optimal consumption policy, which makes it relatively slower. Nevertheless, we can use clever tricks to speed up the process. One such trick used in this paper is to use the optimal consumption policy from the previous iteration as the initial guess for the next iteration. This is possible because the optimal consumption policy is a continuous function of the grid of market resources and the optional decision from one period to the next is not too different. This is the method used in the code for this paper.

\section{Quantitative Strategy}\label{Quantitative Strategy}

This section describes the quantitative strategy used for calibrating and estimating the Life Cycle Incomplete Markets model with and without Wealth in the Utility Function, following the works of \cite{Cagetti_2003}, \cite{Palumbo_1999}, \cite{Gourinchas_2002}, and \cite{Sabelhaus_2010}, among others. The main objective is to find a set of parameters that can best match the empirical moments of some real-life data using simulation.

\subsection{Calibration}\label{Calibration}

The calibration of the Life Cycle Incomplete Markets model necessitates a richness not present in the SIM model precisely because we are interested in the heterogeneity of agents across different stages of the life cycle, such as the early working period, parenthood, saving for retirement, and retirement. To calibrate this model, we need to identify important patterns in preferences, mortality, and income risk across the life cycle. The first and perhaps most important departure from SIM is that life is finite and agents don't life forever; moreover, the terminal age is not certain as the probability of staying alive decreases with age. In this model, households start their life cycle at age $t = 25$ and live with certainty until retirement at age $t = 65$. After retirement, the probability of staying alive decreases with age, and the terminal age is set to $t = 91$. During their early adulthood, their utility of consumption might need to be adjusted by the arrival and subsequent departure of children. This is handled by a `household-size-adjusted' discount factor that is greater than 1.0 in the presence of children. This is the rationale for parameters $\Alive_{t}$ and $\hat{\DiscFac}_{t}$ in the model, whose values we take from \cite{Cagetti_2003} directly.

The unemployment probability is taken from \cite{Carroll_1992} to be $\pZero = 0.5$ which represents a long run equilibrium of 5\% unemployment in the United States. The remaining life cycle attributes for the distribution of shocks to income ($\PermGroFac_{t}, \ \sigma_{[\PermShk, t]}, \ \sigma_{[\xi, t]}$) are taken from \cite{Sabelhaus_2010}. In their paper, they analyze the variability of labor earnings growth rates between the 80's and 90's and find evidence for the ``Great Moderation'', a decline in variability of earnings across all age groups.

After careful calibration based on the Life Cycle Incomplete Markets literature, we can structurally estimate the remaining parameters $\beth$ and $\CRRA$ to match specific empirical moments of the wealth distribution.

\subsection{Estimation}\label{Estimation}

Structural estimation consists of finding the set of parameters that, when used to solve and simulate the model, result in simulated moments that are as close as possible to the empirical moments observed in the data. For this exercise, we focus on matching the median of the wealth to permanent income ratio for 7 age groups starting from age 25-30 up to age 56-60. The data is aggregated from the waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). Matching the median has been standard in the literature precisely because it has been so difficult to match the mean of the wealth distribution given the high degree of wealth inequality in the United States. The Wealth in the Utility Function models however are constructed to better match the dispersion of wealth accumulation, and in future work we will attempt to match the mean of the wealth distribution as well.

Given an initial vector of parameters $\Theta_0 = \{\beth_0, \CRRA_0 \}$, the first step in the estimation procedure is to solve for the steady state of the model. As this is a life cycle exercise, the strategy is to start from the terminal period and work backwards to the initial period. This is known as backward induction. The terminal period is characterized by simple decisions over consumption and bequest, as the agent is certain to die and has no continuation value and thus no use for savings. Having constructed the terminal policy functions and their corresponding value and marginal value, we can solve for the optimal policies in the second to last period using the methods described in the previous section. We can then continue this process until we arrive at the initial period. In the end, and unlike in the SIM model, we have a complete set of policy functions for consumption and saving for every age of the life cycle.

Having solved the steady state of the model for the given set of parameters, we can now use the optimal policy functions to generate simulated data of consumption and savings over the life cycle. We can then calculate the simulated moments of the wealth distribution at the 7 age groups. We can define the objective function as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:naivePowell}
g(\Theta) =  \sum_{\tau=1}^{7} \weight_{\tau} |\varsigma^{\tau} -\mathbf{s}^{\tau}(\Theta)|
\end{equation}

where $\varsigma^{\tau}$ is the empirical moment of the wealth distribution at age $\tau$, $\mathbf{s}^{\tau}(\Theta)$ is the simulated moment of the wealth distribution at age $\tau$ for a given set of parameters $\Theta$, and $\weight_{\tau}$ is the population weight for a particular age group in our data. The goal is thus to minimize the objective function by choice of $\Theta$ such that  $\hat{\Theta} = \arg \min_{\Theta} g(\Theta)$. To find $\hat{\Theta}$, we use the Nelder-Mead algorithm which uses a simplex method and does not require derivatives of the objective function. This consists of trying a significant number of guesses for $\Theta$, solving the model, and simulating moments which can be quite computationally intensive. Future work will focus on using more efficient methods such as those presented by \cite{Auclert_2021}, where the Jacobian (partial first derivatives) of the objective function is used to find the optimal parameters $\hat{\Theta}$ more efficiently and quickly.

\textbf{Results for WUFIM models} We can see the estimated parameters for our alternative specifications of the LCIM with Wealth in the Utility Function (WUFIM) in Table~\ref{WUFIMestimation}. The estimated values for $\beth$ and $\CRRA$ are 0.866 and 3.756, respectively, for the LCIM with portfolio choice, 0.876 and 3.506, respectively, for the separable WUFIM, 0.864 and 3.806, respectively, for the separable WUFIM with portfolio choice, and 0.601 and 5.032, respectively, for the non-separable WUFIM. The standard errors are estimated via the bootstrap. Additionally, Figure~\ref{fig:AllSMMcontour} shows a contour plot of the objective function for the structural estimation exercise where the red star represents the estimated parameters. From these results, a clear pattern emerges which is worth discussion and further analysis. The estimated paramters for the Separable WUFIM model are not very different from those in LCIM model, which perhaps points at the inability of warm glow bequest models to resolve many of the issues of the SIM and LCIM model. The separable WUFIM model does not produce significant differences in the accumulation of wealth over the life cycle beyond a simple shifting out of the savings function. When we add a portfolio choice to either model, the pure discount factor $\beth$ becomes slightly lower and the coefficient of risk aversion $\CRRA$ increases by a few decimal points. This is because, as the portfolio choice model exposes agents to more risk, they become both more risk averse and more patient. Finally, the non-separable WUFIM model produces a much lower estimate of the pure discount factor $\beth$ and a much higher estimate of the coefficient of risk aversion $\CRRA$. This could be because of the dynamic complementarity between consumption and savings, which causes agents to save more in order to enjoy their consumption even more. This is an important result that requires further exploration.
